## Project Idea
- site revolving around online shopping and style guides
	- it can have tools that help search
	- input favorite stores, and it will notify everytime there is new stock or when items on the wishlist are available
	- image search thing to find similar clothes using pixel finder

## Our Why:
  - help other teens their age find their style 
  - fashion helps boosts people confidence when they wear what they want and feel good in it
  - We want to promote more positivitiy on campus through highlighting different styles
  - picked this idea because there could be a lot of database usage which will challenge us more than just frontend coding
  - We want to challenge ourselves by using more APIs and we think that this idea could include a lot of them

## Our Why:
  - help other teens their age find their style 
  - fashion helps boosts people confidence when they wear what they want and feel good in it
  - We want to promote more positivitiy on campus through highlighting different styles
  - picked this idea because there could be a lot of database usage which will challenge us more than just frontend coding
  - We want to challenge ourselves by using more APIs and we think that this idea could include a lot of them

## Next Steps For The Site
- Create a drop down bar for the different items
- Re-format the items so that they are horizontally listed instead of vertically
